# tools/

## macOS and Linux

Requires Node 22+, git, and Java 25. On macOS install Java with `brew install openjdk@25`; on
Linux install your distribution's Java 25 JDK (Arch: `pacman -S jdk25-openjdk`) or set
`JAVA_HOME` to one. `unix.mjs` uses that JDK directly, so no system Java changes are needed.

```sh
node tools/unix.mjs launch --backend sim            # free simulated team
node tools/unix.mjs stop --profile sim
node tools/unix.mjs launch --repo /path/to/repo --use-claude-login
node tools/unix.mjs stop                           # save/quit game, stop Foreman
```

Short form for the common case (defaults to the opencode backend):

```sh
./tools/run.sh --repo /path/to/repo --goal "Add a --version flag"
./tools/run.sh --repo /path/to/repo --backend agy --preset heavy   # backend: opencode|agy|claude|sim
./tools/run.sh --repo /path/to/repo --no-game      # Foreman only, no Minecraft
./tools/run.sh --repo /path/to/repo -- --transient-retries 5   # extra Foreman flags after --
```

`--goal "<text>"` submits a goal at startup; `--repo` is repeatable (default: the
current directory's git repo, so bare `agentcraft --goal "..."` just works). A single
`--repo` also pins the in-game console to that repo (no "which repo?" prompt, even if
the Foreman still knows stale repos from earlier launches). If a previous
Foreman still holds the port, `./tools/run.sh --kill [--port N]` kills it
(only `node` processes; anything else is refused with the pid). The backend
retries transient network errors automatically (`--transient-retries <n>`,
default 3, `0` disables); use `/task <id> retry` in game chat (or the Task Wall
Retry button) once the top banner shows the Foreman link is back.

One-click Prism start (the default game): `--prism` is implied, so plain `run.sh`
starts the Foreman, then launches the Prism instance straight into the world
(defaults: the only instance, else `--prism-instance ID`; `--prism-world NAME`,
default `AgentCraft HQ` when that world exists in the instance). `--headless`
runs the Gradle dev client instead; `--no-game` starts only the Foreman. The game
inherits `AGENTCRAFT_PORT/HOME/PROFILE` so the mod links to this Foreman:

```sh
./tools/run.sh --repo /path/to/repo --goal "Add a --version flag" --prism
```

The launcher installs npm dependencies on first use, runs the Fabric development client,
and waits for the studio world. It reuses a running Foreman or game from the same profile.
Use `--dev` for mute/no focus/no notifications; `--no-game` or `--no-foreman` to run just
one component; `--no-wait` to return immediately while Minecraft builds. Repeat
`--foreman-arg VALUE` to pass extra Foreman options. Logs and process records live in
`artifacts/logs/unix-*.log` and `artifacts/run/unix-*.json`. `stop` only signals processes
recorded by this launcher. Agent decisions show a desktop notification (Notification Center on
macOS, `notify-send` on Linux). The screenshot QA command, `node tools/qa.mjs`, also uses this
launcher on macOS and Linux.

### Your own launcher instance (Prism, MultiMC, ...)

The mod also runs in a normal Fabric instance for Minecraft 26.3 with Fabric Loader 0.19.5+:

1. Build the mod: `JAVA_HOME=<Java 25 JDK> sh mod/gradlew -p mod build`, then copy
   `mod/build/libs/agentcraft-<version>.jar` and Fabric API (`fabric_api_version` in
   `mod/gradle.properties`) into the instance's `mods/` folder.
2. Set the instance's environment variables `AGENTCRAFT_MUTE=0` (otherwise the mod forces your
   master and music volume to 0) and `AGENTCRAFT_FOCUS=1`. See mod/DEV.md for the rest.
3. Start only the Foreman: `node tools/unix.mjs launch --no-game --backend sim` (or `--repo ...`).
4. Launch the instance. The title screen loads (or creates) the `AgentCraft HQ` world.

`node tools/devcli.mjs state` reports the running game either way while the DevBridge is on.

## Windows

Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and Node 22. `launch.ps1` installs the npm dependencies it needs on the
first run (`npm ci` in `foreman/` and `tools/`); the Gradle wrapper downloads Gradle, Minecraft
and Fabric by itself. Java 25 must be installed (Temurin 25: https://adoptium.net).

## Daily use

```powershell
tools\launch.ps1                              # claude backend, state in ~/.agentcraft, Foreman :7878, DevBridge :7879
tools\launch.ps1 -Repo C:\code\life-tracker   # also register a repo with the Foreman
tools\launch.ps1 -Backend sim                 # scripted demo team (no API calls), demo repo in sandbox/
tools\launch.ps1 -Showcase                    # static showcase state (sim); -Showcase late for the later one
tools\stop.ps1                                # stop what launch.ps1 started (game + Foreman)
tools\stop.ps1 -Game                          # just the game: agents keep working, relaunch any time
```

From `cmd.exe` or Explorer: `tools\launch.cmd` / `tools\stop.cmd` (same arguments).

`launch.ps1`:
1. Reuses a running Foreman for `<home>/<profile>` (its `foreman.json` pid alive + port answering),
   otherwise starts one in the background (hidden console; log `artifacts\logs\foreman-<profile>.log`).
2. Builds if needed and starts Minecraft (`gradlew runClient`, `GRADLE_USER_HOME` =
   `<repo>\.gradle-home`), passing `AGENTCRAFT_PORT`, `AGENTCRAFT_DEV_PORT`, `AGENTCRAFT_HOME`,
   `AGENTCRAFT_PROFILE`, `AGENTCRAFT_MUTE=0`, `AGENTCRAFT_FOCUS=1` to the game. Log: `artifacts\logs\game.log`.
3. Waits until the HQ world is ready and prints what runs where and how to stop it.

If the game of this checkout is already running it is reused (one client per checkout: they share
`mod/run`). Quitting the game window leaves the Foreman running (agents keep working); the next
`launch.ps1` reuses it.

| parameter | default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-Backend sim\|claude\|antigravity\|opencode` | `opencode` (`AGENTCRAFT_BACKEND`) | `-Showcase` implies `sim` |
| `-Repo <path>[,<path>]` | | registered at start, or sent as `repo.add` to a running Foreman |
| `-Profile <name>` | backend name; `showcase` / `showcase-late` | state lives in `<home>/<profile>` |
| `-Showcase [busy\|late]` | | hold a static scripted state (QA screenshots); always a fresh (`--reset`) profile |
| `-Home <dir>` | `~/.agentcraft` (`AGENTCRAFT_HOME`); with `-Dev`: `<main checkout>\.agentcraft-home` | **QA/tests must pass the project home** |
| `-Port N` / `-DevPort N` | 7878 / 7879 (`AGENTCRAFT_PORT` / `AGENTCRAFT_DEV_PORT`) | 3000/5173/8080 are refused |
| `-Dev` | | unattended runs: muted, never steals focus, no toasts, Gradle daemon exits after 30 idle min |
| `-Reset` | | wipe the profile before starting (new Foreman only) |
| `-Speed x`, `-Autostart`, `-Goal "..."` | | sim speed / start the scripted goal / submit a goal at start |
| `-ForemanArgs @('--workers','kit,wren')` | | extra Foreman flags (`npm run start -- --help`) |
| `-Notify` / `-NoNotify` | Foreman default (on for real backends) | Windows toasts |
| `-NoGame`, `-NoForeman`, `-NoWait` | | only the Foreman / only the game / don't wait for the world |
| `-GradleHome <dir>` | `GRADLE_USER_HOME` or `<main checkout>\.gradle-home` | |
| `-TimeoutSec N` | 600 | how long to wait for the world |
| `-SummaryJson <file>` | | machine-readable result (what was started or reused, pids, ports, logs) |
| `-DryRun` | | print the Foreman command, the game command and the game env; start nothing |

`stop.ps1` stops only what `launch.ps1` started, using the run files in `artifacts\run\`
(pid + process start time, so a reused pid is never touched): the game via the DevBridge
`dev.quit` (world saved), the Foreman via Ctrl+Break into its hidden console (the Foreman saves
its state and releases `foreman.json`, like Ctrl+C in a terminal), then, after `-TimeoutSec`
(30), a force-kill of only those process trees. A Foreman that `launch.ps1` reused but did not
start is left alone. `-Game` / `-Foreman` / `-Profile` / `-Home` / `-Port` narrow it down;
`-FromSummary <launch summary>` stops exactly what one launch started; `-StopDaemon` also stops
this checkout's Gradle daemon (never another checkout's).
